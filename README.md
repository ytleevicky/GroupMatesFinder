# GroupMatesFinder System

In the present day, most university courses require students to complete group projects. But most of the time, working on a group project can be a nightmare for many students due to the group formation issue and the free-riding problem. After all, group work can be either a blessing or a curse for a project if you don’t find the right group-mates.

In the current market, various collaboration tools have already developed to engage students to work collaboratively during the project development stage. However, no tools are currently available to enhance the beginning phase of a group project. 

In light of the above situations, the proposed GroupMatesFinder system (web-based system) is going to solve these issues by improving the group formation process, helping students to find quality group-mates and facilitating the peer evaluation process.

#### Version info

This app was originally generated on Sat Oct 24 2020 17:25:46 GMT+0800 (香港標準時間) using Sails v1.2.3.

<!-- Internally, Sails used [`sails-generate@1.16.13`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate/tree/v1.16.13/lib/core-generators/new). -->



<!--
Note:  Generators are usually run using the globally-installed `sails` CLI (command-line interface).  This CLI version is _environment-specific_ rather than app-specific, thus over time, as a project's dependencies are upgraded or the project is worked on by different developers on different computers using different versions of Node.js, the Sails dependency in its package.json file may differ from the globally-installed Sails CLI release it was originally generated with.  (Be sure to always check out the relevant [upgrading guides](https://sailsjs.com/upgrading) before upgrading the version of Sails used by your app.  If you're stuck, [get help here](https://sailsjs.com/support).)
